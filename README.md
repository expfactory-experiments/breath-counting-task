# Breath Counting Task

Experiment Factory: Breath Counting Task, based on Levinson et al. (2014, Study 2).

This is a task that is friendly for use in the [Experiment Factory](https://expfactory.github.io/expfactory). You can run it locally by putting these files in a web server, or use the Experiment Factory to generate a reproducible container. Check out the documentation above for more information, or [post an issue](https://www.github.com/expfactory/expfactory/issues) if you have any questions.

## Containers and Metadata
The repository builds and provides a set of containers and metadata files to help you run and understand the experiment.

 - [preview the experiment](https://expfactory-experiments.github.io/breath-counting-task/) on Github pages
 - [use the container](https://hub.docker.com/r/expfactory/breath-counting-task/) provided on Docker Hub, built from this repository. All previous versions are also found here based on Github commits.
 - [inspect metadata](https://github.com/expfactory-experiments/breath-counting-task/tree/gh-pages) including manifests and packages associated with Github commits. While this table isn't rendered on Github pages, if you render the branch and look at the index.html you will have a pretty rendering of it. 

## Processing Data in R

[expfactory.breathcounting](expfactory.breathcounting) is an `R` package for processing the data generated by this task.
